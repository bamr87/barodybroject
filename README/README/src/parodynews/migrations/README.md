# migrations Directory

## Purpose
This directory contains Django database migration files for the parodynews application. These migrations define database schema changes, table creation, field modifications, and data transformations that evolve the database structure over time while maintaining data integrity.

## Contents
- `__init__.py`: Python package initialization file making this directory a Python package
- Migration files (generated by Django): Python files that define database schema changes and data migrations

## Usage
Django migrations are managed through Django's migration framework:

```bash
# Create new migrations after model changes
python manage.py makemigrations parodynews

# Apply migrations to database
python manage.py migrate

# Show migration status
python manage.py showmigrations

# Reverse migrations (if needed)
python manage.py migrate parodynews <migration_number>

# Create empty migration for custom operations
python manage.py makemigrations --empty parodynews
```

Migration workflow:
1. **Model Changes**: Modify Django models in `models.py`
2. **Generate Migrations**: Run `makemigrations` to create migration files
3. **Review**: Check generated migration files for correctness
4. **Apply**: Run `migrate` to apply changes to database
5. **Version Control**: Commit migration files with model changes

## Container Configuration
Migrations are executed within the Django application environment:
- Applied automatically during container startup in production
- Can be run manually in development containers
- Database connection configured through Django settings
- Support for PostgreSQL, SQLite, and other Django-supported databases

- Outgoing: Applied to database to create/modify tables and data structures
