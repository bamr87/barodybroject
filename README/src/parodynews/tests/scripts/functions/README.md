# functions Directory

## Purpose
This directory contains reusable test functions and utilities that support the test scripts in the parent directory. It provides common testing functionality for user authentication, account creation, and shared utilities that can be imported and used across multiple test scripts to reduce code duplication and improve test maintainability.

## Contents
- `__init__.py`: Python package initialization file making this directory a test utilities module
- `user_login.py`: Utility functions for testing user authentication and login workflows
- `user_create.py`: Utility functions for testing user account creation and registration processes
- `__pycache__/`: Subdirectory for Python bytecode cache (auto-generated)

## Usage
Test functions are imported and used by test scripts:

```python
# Example usage in test scripts
from .functions.user_login import authenticate_test_user, test_login_flow
from .functions.user_create import create_test_user, validate_user_creation

# Using shared test functions
def test_user_authentication_workflow():
    """Test complete user authentication workflow."""
    # Create test user
    user = create_test_user(
        username="testuser",
        email="test@example.com",
        password="securepass123"
    )
    
    # Test login flow
    login_result = test_login_flow(user.username, "securepass123")
    assert login_result.success is True
    
    # Authenticate user for subsequent tests
    authenticated_user = authenticate_test_user(user)
    assert authenticated_user.is_authenticated is True
```

Function features:
- **User Management**: Common user creation and authentication testing patterns
- **Reusable Utilities**: Shared functions that eliminate code duplication across test scripts
- **Consistent Testing**: Standardized approaches to testing user workflows
- **Mock Integration**: Functions for mocking external dependencies and API calls
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and validation in test utilities

## Container Configuration
Test functions available in containerized test environment:
- Functions loaded as part of test utilities package during pytest execution
- User creation and authentication functions work with test database
- Mock utilities compatible with container-based testing infrastructure
