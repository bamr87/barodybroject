# messages Directory

## Purpose
This directory contains message templates for user session management feedback in the parody news generator application. It provides localized messages that inform users about session-related actions and their outcomes.

## Contents
- `sessions_logged_out.txt`: Django template for displaying confirmation messages when users sign out of other sessions

## Usage
These message templates are automatically displayed by Django's messaging framework:

```django
{% load i18n %}
{% blocktranslate %}Signed out of all other sessions.{% endblocktranslate %}
```

Message features:
- **Internationalization**: Uses Django's i18n system for multi-language support
- **User Feedback**: Provides clear confirmation of session management actions
- **Security Notifications**: Informs users when security-related actions are completed
- **Consistent Messaging**: Maintains consistent tone and formatting across the application

## Container Configuration
Messages are rendered through the Django application:
- Processed by Django's template engine during request handling
- Integrated with Django's messaging framework for user notifications
- Supports dynamic language switching based on user preferences
- Cached for performance in container environments
