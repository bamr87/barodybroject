# Coding Guidelines

## Introduction

These are VS Code coding guidelines. Please also review our [Source Code Organisation](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Source-Code-Organization) page.

## Indentation

We use tabs, not spaces.

## Naming Conventions

* Use PascalCase for `type` names
* Use PascalCase for `enum` values
* Use camelCase for `function` and `method` names
* Use camelCase for `property` names and `local variables`
* Use whole words in names when possible

## Types

* Do not export `types` or `functions` unless you need to share it across multiple components
* Do not introduce new `types` or `values` to the global namespace

## Comments

* When there are comments for `functions`, `interfaces`, `enums`, and `classes` use JSDoc style comments

## Strings

* Use "double quotes" for strings shown to the user that need to be externalized (localized)
* Use 'single quotes' otherwise
* All strings visible to the user need to be externalized

## Style

* Use arrow functions `=>` over anonymous function expressions
* Only surround arrow function parameters when necessary. For example, `(x) => x + x` is wrong but the following are correct:

```javascript
x => x + x
(x, y) => x + y
<T>(x: T, y: T) => x === y
```

* Always surround loop and conditional bodies with curly braces
* Open curly braces always go on the same line as whatever necessitates them
* Parenthesized constructs should have no surrounding whitespace. A single space follows commas, colons, and semicolons in those constructs. For example:

```javascript
for (let i = 0, n = str.length; i < 10; i++) {
    if (x < 10) {
        foo();
    }
}

function f(x: number, y: string): void { }
```

## Python & Django

* Follow PEP 8 for Python code style, using 4 spaces for indentation.
* Use Django best practices for models, views, and templates.
* Keep imports grouped and organized: stdlib, third-party, then local apps.
* Prefer function-based or class-based views consistently.
* Limit model methods to logic directly related to that modelâ€™s data.

## Django Project Functionality

This Django application handles AI-driven content creation, user authentication, messaging, and content management. It uses class-based and function-based views, model relationships for grouping assistants, and built-in Django features for security and scalability. Maintain clear separation of concerns between models, views, and templates. Configure app settings (API keys, etc.) in the database or via environment variables for flexible deployment.

Always try to utilize a Django app's built-in features and best practices. For example, use Django's built-in authentication system for user management, and leverage Django's ORM for database interactions. This ensures that the application is maintainable, scalable, and secure.
