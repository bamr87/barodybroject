# Copilot Instructions

https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview

These instructions guide AI-powered development practices through the fundamental principle of **Paths** - the natural, organic routes that emerge in software development. Like water finding its way through terrain, code and information follow paths of least resistance, creating interconnected networks of knowledge and functionality. AI agents continuously discover, define, and refine these paths, enabling sustainable growth and evolution. The guidelines emphasize container-first development within this path-based framework, ensuring all activities occur within isolated, reproducible environments that can flow seamlessly across different contexts.

## ðŸŒŠ The Path Philosophy: Natural Flow in Software Development

### Core Principle: Path of Least Resistance
Software development, like natural systems, inherently follows paths of least resistance. This principle guides every aspect of our work:
- **Code Paths**: Functions naturally flow into one another, creating execution paths that minimize complexity
- **Data Paths**: Information flows through the system via the most efficient routes
- **Knowledge Paths**: Documentation and learning materials connect concepts through intuitive pathways
- **Evolution Paths**: Changes propagate through the codebase following established patterns
- **Collaboration Paths**: Teams interact through well-worn communication channels

### Path Types and Their Interconnections
- **Building Paths**: Code compilation and assembly follow dependency graphs that represent natural build orders
- **Testing Paths**: Test suites traverse the codebase through logical branches, covering critical routes first
- **Evolution Paths**: AI agents identify and follow paths for incremental improvements
- **Patching Paths**: Fixes flow through the system via minimal change routes
- **Deployment Paths**: Applications move from development to production through staged pathways
- **Organization Paths**: File structures emerge organically, creating intuitive navigation routes
- **Programming Paths**: Design patterns create well-traveled routes for solving common problems
- **Orchestration Paths**: Services connect through optimal communication pathways
- **Learning Paths**: Knowledge builds progressively, each concept paving the way for the next
- **Documentation Paths**: Information links create a web of interconnected understanding
- **Branching Paths**: Version control follows natural divergence and convergence patterns

### AI Agents as Path Architects
AI agents serve as intelligent guides that:
- **Discover Paths**: Identify existing patterns and routes within the codebase
- **Design Paths**: Create new pathways for functionality, testing, and deployment
- **Optimize Paths**: Refine routes to reduce friction and improve efficiency
- **Connect Paths**: Build bridges between isolated components
- **Document Paths**: Map the terrain for future travelers
- **Evolve Paths**: Adapt routes based on usage patterns and feedback

### Organic Growth Through Path Networks
Repositories grow like living organisms:
- **Natural Emergence**: Paths form organically through use and need
- **Interconnected Networks**: Information and code build upon each other
- **Adaptive Evolution**: Paths adjust to changing requirements and contexts
- **Collective Intelligence**: Multiple AI agents contribute to path definition
- **Sustainable Expansion**: Growth follows established patterns while allowing innovation

## MCP-Enhanced Path-Driven Development

### Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

The repository now leverages Model Context Protocol (MCP) to standardize AI application context sharing and tool orchestration. MCP serves as the universal interface for AI applications to access external context through well-defined paths.

### Front Matter: Structured Metadata for Path-Aware Development

Front matter provides structured metadata at the beginning of files, acting as a "preface" that enables developers, tools, and AI agents to quickly understand file purpose, structure, and logic. This concept extends from Markdown documentation to source code files, creating a standardized approach for contextual awareness.

#### Front Matter Elements in Path-Based Development

- **Path Context Metadata**: Document how files connect within the larger path network
- **Execution Flow Information**: High-level logic overview for AI comprehension
- **Dependency Mapping**: Clear specification of required modules and services
- **MCP Integration Points**: Define how files interact with MCP servers and capabilities
- **Path Performance Indicators**: Metrics and monitoring information for route optimization

#### Front Matter Structure for Source Code

```

#### MCP Path Principles
- **Standardized Context Paths**: MCP servers expose resources, tools, and prompts through standardized interfaces
- **Path-Aware Server Architecture**: All MCP servers follow path-based execution patterns with comprehensive logging
- **Container-First Deployment**: MCP servers run within isolated containers with defined resource boundaries
- **Tool Orchestration Paths**: Complex workflows chain multiple MCP tools along defined execution paths
- **Context Aggregation Paths**: Multiple MCP servers provide comprehensive context for AI operations

#### MCP-Enhanced Development Workflow
1. **Context Discovery**: Identify available MCP servers and their capabilities
2. **Resource Mapping**: Map application needs to available MCP resources and tools
3. **Path Design**: Design optimal paths through MCP server capabilities
4. **Implementation**: Build applications using standardized MCP client libraries
5. **Integration Testing**: Validate MCP integrations across all server types
6. **Monitoring**: Track MCP operation performance and health
7. **Evolution**: Use MCP context to enhance AI-driven development

## Path-Driven Development Standards

### Path Discovery in Bash/Shell Scripting

#### Naming Conventions Follow Natural Paths
- Variables: Follow data flow paths (e.g., `input_data` â†’ `processed_data` â†’ `output_result`)
- Functions: Name by their position in execution paths (e.g., `validate_input()` â†’ `process_data()` â†’ `format_output()`)
- Scripts: Indicate their role in workflow paths (e.g., `01_setup.sh`, `02_build.sh`, `03_deploy.sh`)

#### Code Structure Creates Clear Paths
- **Entry Points**: Define clear starting paths with descriptive comments
- **Flow Control**: Use path-based logic that follows natural decision trees
- **Modular Paths**: Break scripts into functions that represent path segments
- **Path Documentation**: Comment each path junction and destination

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Path: Environment Setup â†’ Validation â†’ Execution â†’ Cleanup

# Define the main execution path
main() {
    # Path segment: Initial validation
    validate_environment || return 1
    
    # Path segment: Core processing
    process_workflow || return 2
    
    # Path segment: Results handling
    handle_results || return 3
    
    # Path segment: Cleanup
    cleanup_resources
}

# Each function represents a segment in the execution path
```

### Path-Aware Error Handling
- **Path Preservation**: Errors maintain context about which path failed
- **Fallback Paths**: Define alternative routes when primary paths fail
- **Path Logging**: Track the journey through the code for debugging

```bash
# Example of path-aware error handling
execute_with_fallback() {
    local primary_path="$1"
    local fallback_path="$2"
    
    # Try primary path
    if ! $primary_path 2>/dev/null; then
        log_path_failure "Primary path failed: $primary_path"
        # Follow fallback path
        $fallback_path || return 1
    fi
}
```

### Python Path Patterns

#### Path-Based Architecture
- **Import Paths**: Organize imports to reflect dependency paths
- **Execution Paths**: Design clear flows from input to output
- **Data Paths**: Create pipelines that transform data along defined routes

```python
# Path: Input Validation â†’ Data Processing â†’ Output Generation

class DataPipeline:
    """Represents a path through data transformation stages."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.path_history = []
    
    def follow_path(self, data):
        """Follow the transformation path."""
        # Path segment 1: Validation
        validated = self._validate_input(data)
        self.path_history.append("validation")
        
        # Path segment 2: Processing
        processed = self._process_data(validated)
        self.path_history.append("processing")
        
        # Path segment 3: Output
        result = self._generate_output(processed)
        self.path_history.append("output")
        
        return result
```

### JavaScript/Node.js Path Navigation

#### Asynchronous Path Management
- **Promise Paths**: Chain operations along asynchronous paths
- **Event Paths**: Define clear event flow routes through the application
- **Module Paths**: Organize code to reflect functional pathways

```javascript
// Path: Request â†’ Validation â†’ Processing â†’ Response

class RequestPath {
    constructor() {
        this.pathSegments = [];
    }
    
    async followPath(request) {
        // Define the path through middleware
        const path = [
            this.validateRequest,
            this.authenticateUser,
            this.processRequest,
            this.formatResponse
        ];
        
        // Follow each segment of the path
        let result = request;
        for (const segment of path) {
            result = await segment.call(this, result);
            this.pathSegments.push(segment.name);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

## Container Paths: Isolated Journey Networks

### Container-First Path Development
- **Build Paths**: Multi-stage Dockerfiles create clear transformation paths
- **Deployment Paths**: Containers flow through development â†’ staging â†’ production
- **Network Paths**: Service discovery creates dynamic communication routes
- **Volume Paths**: Data flows through well-defined storage pathways

```dockerfile
# Path: Source â†’ Dependencies â†’ Build â†’ Runtime

# Path Segment 1: Build Environment
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /build-path
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Path Segment 2: Application Build
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Path Segment 3: Runtime Path
FROM node:18-alpine AS runtime
WORKDIR /app-path
COPY --from=builder /build-path/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder /build-path/node_modules ./node_modules

# Define the execution path
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

### Orchestration Paths
- **Service Paths**: Define how services discover and communicate
- **Scaling Paths**: Automatic scaling follows load distribution paths
- **Health Check Paths**: Monitoring follows defined inspection routes

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml - Defining service communication paths
version: '3.8'

services:
  # Path: Client â†’ Gateway â†’ Services â†’ Database
  
  gateway:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: gateway.Dockerfile
    environment:
      - SERVICE_PATHS=api:3000,auth:3001,data:3002
    networks:
      - service-path
  
  api:
    build: ./api
    networks:
      - service-path
    depends_on:
      - database
  
  database:
    image: postgres:15
    networks:
      - service-path
    volumes:
      - data-path:/var/lib/postgresql/data

networks:
  service-path:
    driver: bridge

volumes:
  data-path:
```

## Conclusion: The Front Matter Enhanced Living Path Network

Software repositories are living networks of interconnected paths enhanced by Model Context Protocol (MCP) capabilities and structured front matter metadata. Like a garden where footpaths emerge from regular use, our codebases develop natural routes that connect functionality, knowledge, and people - now with standardized AI context sharing through MCP servers and comprehensive front matter documentation that serves as intelligent signposts throughout the journey.

AI agents act as gardeners, tending these paths, creating new connections through MCP integrations, and interpreting front matter directives to ensure the network remains healthy and navigable. By embracing the path of least resistance enhanced with MCP capabilities and front matter intelligence, we create software that flows naturally, scales organically, and evolves sustainably with comprehensive AI context.

Every line of code, every test, every document, and every MCP server is both a step on a path and a potential junction for new routes. Front matter provides the contextual intelligence that enables AI agents to understand not just what code does, but why it exists, how it connects to other components, and what intentions guided its creation. MCP servers provide standardized access points for AI applications to gather context, execute tools, and generate prompts, while front matter serves as the bridge between human intent and machine understanding.

As paths interconnect and build upon each other through MCP-enhanced capabilities and front matter guidance, they enable rapid development, comprehensive context sharing, and continuous evolution guided by AI intelligence that truly understands the codebase's structure, purpose, and evolution.

The future of software development lies in this symbiotic relationship between path-based organic growth, standardized AI context protocols, and structured metadata intelligence, where MCP serves as the universal interface and front matter provides the contextual wisdom for AI applications to understand, interact with, and enhance our codebase ecosystems with unprecedented precision and understanding.
