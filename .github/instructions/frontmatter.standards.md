# Unified Frontmatter Standards

This document defines the standardized frontmatter structure and metadata requirements for instruction files across all repositories in the ecosystem (IT-Journey, Barodybroject, Zer0-Mistakes).

## üéØ Frontmatter Philosophy

Frontmatter serves as structured metadata that enables:
- **AI Understanding**: VS Code Copilot and other AI tools can better understand file context
- **Cross-Repository Consistency**: Unified standards across all projects
- **Automated Processing**: Scripts can parse and validate instruction files
- **Dependency Management**: Clear relationships between instruction files
- **Evolution Tracking**: Version control and change management

## üìã Universal Frontmatter Template

### Required Fields (All Instruction Files)

```yaml
---
file: filename.instructions.md
description: "Brief description of the instruction file's purpose and scope"
author: "Team Name or Individual Author"
created: YYYY-MM-DD
lastModified: YYYY-MM-DD
version: X.Y.Z
---
```

### Extended Template (Comprehensive)

```yaml
---
file: filename.instructions.md
description: "Brief description of the instruction file's purpose and scope"
author: "Team Name or Individual Author"
created: YYYY-MM-DD
lastModified: YYYY-MM-DD

    VARIABLE_NAME: "description or value"
  resources:
    cpu: "resource_range"
    memory: "memory_range"

    description: "Description of changes made"
    author: "Author of changes"

notes: "Additional notes or important considerations"
---
```

    - "workflow enhancement"
```

## üîÑ Version Management Standards

### Semantic Versioning for Instruction Files

**MAJOR (X.0.0)**: Breaking changes to instruction structure or fundamental approach
- Complete rewrite of instruction methodology
- Incompatible changes to frontmatter structure
- Major architectural shifts in development approach

**MINOR (0.X.0)**: New features or significant enhancements
- Addition of new instruction sections
- New VS Code Copilot integration patterns
- Enhanced workflow or process documentation

**PATCH (0.0.X)**: Bug fixes, clarifications, and minor improvements
- Typo corrections and clarity improvements
- Updated examples or code snippets
- Minor formatting or organizational changes

### Change Documentation Requirements

Every version update MUST include:
```yaml
changelog:
  - date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
    description: "Specific description of what changed"
    author: "Person who made the changes"
    type: "major | minor | patch"
    breaking_changes: "Description if applicable"
```

## üîó Dependency Management

### Dependency Types

**Direct Dependencies**: Files that this instruction file directly references or builds upon
```yaml
dependencies:
  - copilot-instructions.md: "Core principles and foundation"
  - space.instructions.md: "Project organization standards"
```

**Related Files**: Files that complement or work alongside this instruction file
```yaml
related_files:
  - features.instructions.md: "Feature development patterns"
  - test.instructions.md: "Testing standards and validation"
```

**Cross-Repository References**: References to instruction files in other repositories
```yaml
cross_repo_references:
  - repo: "it-journey"
    file: "quest.instructions.md"
    relationship: "Educational content creation patterns"
  - repo: "zer0-mistakes"
    file: "layouts.instructions.md"
    relationship: "Jekyll theme development standards"
```

## ü§ñ VS Code Copilot Integration Metadata

### AI-Specific Frontmatter Extensions

```yaml
ai_integration:
  copilot_optimization: true
  prompt_patterns:
    - "Common VS Code Copilot prompts for this instruction type"
  context_requirements:
    - "Information AI needs to provide effective assistance"
  quality_criteria:
    - "Standards for evaluating AI-generated content"
automation_support:
  validation_scripts:
    - "script_name.py: validation purpose"
  generation_tools:
    - "tool_name: what it generates"
  maintenance_workflows:
    - "workflow_name: maintenance task"
```

## üìä Quality Assurance Standards

### Frontmatter Validation Requirements

Every instruction file frontmatter MUST:
- [ ] Include all required fields with appropriate values
- [ ] Use consistent date formats (YYYY-MM-DD for dates, ISO 8601 for timestamps)
- [ ] Have valid YAML syntax and structure
- [ ] Include accurate dependency references
- [ ] Maintain version consistency with content changes
- [ ] Include appropriate container requirements if applicable

### Cross-Reference Integrity

- [ ] All dependency references point to existing files
- [ ] Version numbers follow semantic versioning standards
- [ ] Container requirements are accurate and testable
- [ ] Path definitions are logical and implementable
- [ ] Changelog entries are complete and descriptive

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Guidelines

### Creating New Instruction Files

1. **Start with Template**: Use the appropriate frontmatter template
2. **Define Dependencies**: Identify and document all dependencies
3. **Specify Container Requirements**: If applicable, define container needs
4. **Document Workflows**: Include relevant path definitions
5. **Validate Structure**: Ensure frontmatter is valid YAML

### Updating Existing Instruction Files

1. **Update Version**: Increment version number appropriately
2. **Update lastModified**: Set to current date
3. **Add Changelog Entry**: Document what changed
4. **Review Dependencies**: Ensure dependencies are still accurate
5. **Validate Changes**: Test that examples and references still work

### Cross-Repository Harmonization

1. **Identify Common Patterns**: Find shared instruction patterns
2. **Standardize Frontmatter**: Apply unified frontmatter structure
3. **Update Cross-References**: Ensure accurate cross-repository links
4. **Validate Consistency**: Check for consistent terminology and approach
5. **Document Relationships**: Clearly define how repositories relate

---

*These frontmatter standards ensure consistency, maintainability, and AI-optimization across all instruction files in the ecosystem while supporting the unique needs of each repository.*
