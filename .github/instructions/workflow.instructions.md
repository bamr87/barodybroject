# GitHub Actions Workflow Instructions

These instructions provide comprehensive guidance for creating and maintaining GitHub Actions workflows within the AI-seed ecosystem, emphasizing standardized patterns, path-based execution, and AI Evolution Engine integration.

## Workflow Philosophy and Standards

### Path-Based Workflow Design

GitHub Actions workflows should follow natural execution paths that minimize complexity while ensuring reliability, consistency, and maintainability. Each workflow represents a defined path through the CI/CD pipeline.

#### Core Workflow Principles
- **Standardization**: Use consistent patterns across all workflows
- **Path Optimization**: Design workflows to follow the most efficient execution routes
- **Error Resilience**: Include robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
- **Evolution Integration**: Support AI-driven workflow improvements
- **Container-First**: Execute all operations within isolated environments

## Standard Workflow Structure

### Required Workflow Elements

#### Universal Environment Variables
All workflows MUST include these standard environment variables:

```yaml
env:
  EVOLUTION_VERSION: "0.3.0"
  WORKFLOW_TYPE: "descriptive_name"  # e.g., "manual_evolution", "scheduled_evolution", "testing_automation"
```

#### Standard Permissions
Use these permissions consistently across all workflows:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  issues: write
```

#### Standardized Checkout Configuration
Always use this checkout pattern for consistency:

```yaml
- name: 🌱 Prepare Evolution Environment
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0
    token: ${{ secrets.PAT_TOKEN_TOKEN }}
```

### Common Input Parameters

#### Growth Modes for Evolution Workflows
Define these input options for AI evolution workflows:

```yaml
inputs:
  growth_mode:
    description: 'Evolution approach and risk level'
    required: false
    default: 'adaptive'
    type: choice
    options:
      - 'conservative'     # Safe, minimal changes with thorough validation
      - 'adaptive'         # Balanced approach with moderate changes and validation
      - 'experimental'     # Advanced features and experimental changes
      - 'test-automation'  # Focus on testing improvements and automation
      - 'build-optimization' # Focus on build and CI/CD improvements
      - 'error-resilience' # Focus on error handling and recovery patterns
      - 'ci-cd-enhancement' # Focus on CI/CD pipeline improvements
```

#### Intensity Levels
Define intensity levels for change scope:

```yaml
inputs:
  intensity:
    description: 'Scope and impact level of changes'
    required: false
    default: 'moderate'
    type: choice
    options:
      - 'minimal'         # Small, safe changes with low risk
      - 'moderate'        # Medium-sized improvements with moderate risk
      - 'comprehensive'   # Large-scale improvements with higher impact
```

#### Dry Run Support
ALL evolution workflows MUST include dry run capability:

```yaml
inputs:
  dry_run:
    description: 'Run in simulation mode without making actual changes'
    required: false
    default: false
    type: boolean
```

## Standard Workflow Patterns

### Environment Setup Pattern
All workflows should follow this environment setup pattern:

```yaml
- name: 🛠️ Setup Environment
  run: |
    set -euo pipefail
    if [ ! -f "./scripts/setup-environment.sh" ]; then
      echo "❌ Setup script not found!"
      exit 1
    fi
    chmod +x ./scripts/setup-environment.sh
    ./scripts/setup-environment.sh
```

### Script Execution Pattern
Always make scripts executable and include error handling:

```yaml
- name: 🧬 Execute Script
  run: |
    set -euo pipefail
    script_path="./scripts/script-name.sh"
    
    if [ ! -f "$script_path" ]; then
      echo "❌ Script not found: $script_path"
      exit 1
    fi
    
    chmod +x "$script_path"
    "$script_path" arg1 arg2
```

### Dry Run Implementation Pattern
Include dry run support in all evolution workflows:

```yaml
- name: 🔍 Dry Run - Preview Changes
  if: env.DRY_RUN == 'true' || inputs.dry_run == true
  run: |
    set -euo pipefail
    echo "🔍 DRY RUN MODE - Changes that would be applied:"
    
    if [ -f "/tmp/evolution_response.json" ]; then
      if command -v jq >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        cat "/tmp/evolution_response.json" | jq -r '.changes[] | "\(.type): \(.file)"' 2>/dev/null || echo "No changes preview available"
      else
        echo "Preview data available in /tmp/evolution_response.json"
      fi
    else
      echo "No preview data available"
    fi
```

### Error Validation Pattern
Include validation steps before critical operations:

```yaml
- name: 🔍 Validate Prerequisites
  run: |
    set -euo pipefail
    
    # Validate required files exist
    required_files=("./scripts/setup-environment.sh" "./scripts/evolution-engine.sh")
    for file in "${required_files[@]}"; do
      if [ ! -f "$file" ]; then
        echo "❌ Required file missing: $file"
        exit 1
      fi
    done
    
    # Validate environment variables
    required_vars=("EVOLUTION_VERSION" "WORKFLOW_TYPE")
    for var in "${required_vars[@]}"; do
      if [ -z "${!var:-}" ]; then
        echo "❌ Required environment variable missing: $var"
        exit 1
      fi
    done
    
    echo "✅ All prerequisites validated"
```

## Naming Conventions and Standards

### Step Naming Standards
- **Use Emojis**: Include descriptive emojis for improved readability
  - 🌱 for environment preparation
  - 🛠️ for setup and configuration
  - 🧬 for core evolution/processing
  - 🔍 for validation and dry runs
  - 📝 for documentation and reporting
  - 🚀 for deployment and release
  - 🧹 for cleanup operations

### Variable Naming Standards
- **Environment Variables**: Use UPPER_CASE (e.g., `EVOLUTION_VERSION`)
- **Local Variables**: Use lowercase with underscores (e.g., `script_path`)
- **Input Parameters**: Use lowercase with underscores (e.g., `dry_run`)

### File Path Standards
- **Temporary Files**: Use `/tmp/` for temporary workflow outputs
- **Scripts**: Use relative paths `./scripts/` for script execution
- **Configurations**: Store in predictable, documented locations
- **Artifacts**: Use workflow-specific directories under `/tmp/`

## Error Handling and Resilience

### Required Error Handling Patterns
- **Set Strict Mode**: Always use `set -euo pipefail` in multi-line scripts
- **Validate Inputs**: Check for required files, variables, and conditions
- **Meaningful Messages**: Provide actionable error messages with context
- **Graceful Degradation**: Include fallback mechanisms where appropriate

### Error Recovery Strategies
```yaml
- name: 🔧 Error Recovery
  if: failure()
  run: |
    set -euo pipefail
    
    echo "❌ Workflow failed - attempting recovery"
    
    # Log error context
    echo "Current directory: $(pwd)"
    echo "Available files: $(ls -la)"
    echo "Environment variables: $(env | grep -E '^(EVOLUTION|WORKFLOW)_')"
    
    # Attempt cleanup
    if [ -d "/tmp" ]; then
      echo "Cleaning temporary files..."
      find /tmp -name "*evolution*" -type f -delete 2>/dev/null || true
    fi
    
    # Store failure artifacts
    mkdir -p /tmp/failure-artifacts
    cp -r logs/* /tmp/failure-artifacts/ 2>/dev/null || true
```

## Token Management and Security

### Standard Token Usage
- **Primary Token**: Use `${{ secrets.PAT_TOKEN_TOKEN }}` for most operations
- **Custom Tokens**: Only use custom tokens when additional permissions required
- **Documentation**: Document any special token requirements in workflow comments

### Security Best Practices
```yaml
# Example of secure token usage
- name: 🔐 Secure Operation
  env:
    # Use least-privilege tokens
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PAT_TOKEN_TOKEN }}
  run: |
    # Never echo sensitive values
    echo "Performing operation with secured token"
    
    # Validate token permissions before use
    if ! gh auth status >/dev/null 2>&1; then
      echo "❌ GitHub token authentication failed"
      exit 1
    fi
```

## Version Management

### Version Consistency
- Update `EVOLUTION_VERSION` consistently across all workflows
- Document version changes in workflow comments
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible

### Version Header Template
```yaml
# AI Evolution Workflow - [Workflow Name]
# Version: 0.3.0
# Last Updated: 2025-07-20
# 
# Breaking Changes:
# - [List any breaking changes]
# 
# New Features:
# - [List new features]
```

## Testing and Validation

### Workflow Testing Standards
- **Independent Testing**: Test scripts independently before workflow integration
- **Validation Steps**: Include comprehensive validation at each stage
- **Debug Output**: Provide meaningful output for troubleshooting
- **Rollback Procedures**: Include rollback mechanisms for critical operations

### Test Execution Pattern
```yaml
- name: 🧪 Test Workflow Components
  run: |
    set -euo pipefail
    
    echo "🧪 Testing workflow components..."
    
    # Test script syntax
    for script in ./scripts/*.sh; do
      if [ -f "$script" ]; then
        echo "Checking syntax: $script"
        bash -n "$script" || {
          echo "❌ Syntax error in $script"
          exit 1
        }
      fi
    done
    
    # Test required tools
    required_tools=("jq" "gh" "git")
    for tool in "${required_tools[@]}"; do
      if ! command -v "$tool" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        echo "❌ Required tool missing: $tool"
        exit 1
      fi
    done
    
    echo "✅ All tests passed"
```

- name: 📊 Collect Evolution Context
  run: |
    set -euo pipefail
    
    echo "📊 Collecting repository context for evolution..."
    
    # Collect repository metrics
    ./scripts/collect-context.sh > /tmp/evolution-context.json

    echo "🔄 Applying evolution changes..."
    
    # Apply changes with validation
    ./scripts/apply-changes.sh /tmp/evolution_response.json
    
    # Validate applied changes
    if ! git diff --exit-code HEAD^ HEAD; then
      echo "✅ Changes successfully applied"
    else
      echo "⚠️ No changes were applied"
    fi
```

## Best Practices and Guidelines

### Performance Optimization
- Use GitHub Actions caching for dependencies and build artifacts
- Minimize checkout depth when full history isn't needed
- Parallel job execution for independent operations
- Efficient artifact storage and retrieval

### Maintainability
- Keep workflows focused on single responsibilities
- Use reusable composite actions for common patterns
- Document complex logic with inline comments
- Regular review and cleanup of unused workflows

**Unhealthy Servers:** {len(unhealthy_servers)}

## Server Status Details:

'''
            
            for server in unhealthy_servers:

- **Last Check:** {status.get('last_check', 'unknown')}
'''
            
            issue_body += '''
## Recommended Actions:
1. Check server container logs: `docker logs mcp-{server_name}`
2. Restart unhealthy servers: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.mcp.yml restart`
3. Review server configuration and dependencies
4. Monitor for recovery in next health check cycle
