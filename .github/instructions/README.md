# instructions Directory

## Purpose
This directory contains comprehensive coding instructions and guidelines for AI-assisted development within the barodybroject ecosystem. These instruction files define standards, patterns, and best practices for various programming languages, frameworks, and development workflows, ensuring consistent code quality and development practices across the project.

## Contents
- `space.instructions.md`: Foundational path-based development principles and container-first architecture guidelines
- `project.instructions.md`: Project-specific requirements, conventions, and standards for the barodybroject parody news generator
- `python.instructions.md`: Python-specific development standards, Django patterns, and best practices for backend development
- `javascript.instructions.md`: JavaScript/Node.js standards, frontend development patterns, and React/Vue integration guidelines
- `bash.instructions.md`: Shell scripting standards, automation patterns, and container orchestration scripts
- `markdown.instructions.md`: Documentation standards, Markdown formatting guidelines, and technical writing best practices
- `workflow.instructions.md`: GitHub Actions workflow patterns, CI/CD pipeline standards, and automation guidelines
- `ci-cd.instructions.md`: Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline instructions, deployment automation, and testing integration
- `test.instructions.md`: Testing standards, framework integration, and automated testing best practices
- `docs.instructions.md`: Documentation generation, maintenance standards, and automated documentation workflows
- `mcp.instructions.md`: Model Context Protocol integration patterns and AI-assisted development guidelines

## Usage
Instruction files guide AI-assisted development and code generation:

```yaml
# Example usage in AI development context
coding_standards:
  apply_instructions:
    - space.instructions.md      # Foundation principles
    - project.instructions.md    # Project-specific standards
    - python.instructions.md     # Language-specific patterns
    - ci-cd.instructions.md      # Pipeline standards

development_workflow:
  1. Review applicable instruction files
  2. Apply container-first development principles
  3. Follow language-specific coding standards
  4. Implement path-based architecture patterns
  5. Ensure comprehensive testing and documentation
```

Instruction features:
- **Comprehensive Standards**: Complete development guidelines covering all aspects of the project
- **AI Integration**: Designed for AI-assisted development workflows and code generation
- **Container-First**: Emphasis on containerized development and deployment patterns
- **Path-Based Architecture**: Organic, low-resistance development workflow patterns
- **Quality Assurance**: Testing, linting, and documentation standards for maintainable code
- **Cross-Language Compatibility**: Standards that work across Python, JavaScript, and shell scripting
