Oh, embrace the glory of the test,
Where number two pencils are put to rest.
Scantrons are fed, as teachers await,
While students plot their daring escape.

Standards-based shackles squeeze so tight,
In education's battle, who's wrong, who's right?
Oh, to live in a world where bubbling is key,
Evaluate your worth with A, B, C, or D.

One question comes to mind, across the land:
“If I guess, does higher learning understand?”
The wisdom of a lifetime in four tiny squares,
Yet here we are, pretending anyone cares.

But remember, dear students, keep this in sight:
In the test of life, make sure you still fight.
‘Cause when that exam is over, and you’ve bubbled your best,
There’ll always be another life-long test.

Why don’t scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!
