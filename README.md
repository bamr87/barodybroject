touch .env
echo "CONTAINER_APP_NAME=${GH_TEST_REPO}" >> .env
echo "CONTAINER_APP_ENV_DNS_SUFFIX=localhost" >> .env
echo "DEBUG=True" >> .env
echo "SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key" >> .env
echo "DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3" >> .env
```

or manually create the `.env` file and add the following environment variables:

```plaintext
CONTAINER_APP_NAME=${GH_TEST_REPO}
CONTAINER_APP_ENV_DNS_SUFFIX=localhost
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3
```

3. **Database Migrations**

## Deploy Django Application with PostgreSQL via Azure Container Apps

This project deploys a web application for a space travel agency using Django. The application can be deployed to Azure with Azure Container Apps using the [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview).



```sh
azd auth login
azd init
azd up
```

```sh
# sample site
gh repo clone Azure-Samples/azure-django-postgres-flexible-aca
cd azure-django-postgres-flexible-aca
```

## Opening the project

This project has [Dev Container support](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), so it will be setup automatically if you open it in Github Codespaces or in local VS Code with the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).

If you're *not* using one of those options for opening the project, then you'll need to:

1. Start up a local PostgreSQL server, create a database for the app, and set the following environment variables according to your database configuration.

```shell
export DB_HOST=localhost
export POSTGRES_PORT=5432
export DB_NAME=<YOUR DATABASE>
export DB_USERNAME=<YOUR USERNAME>
export DB_PASSWORD=<YOUR PASSWORD>
```

1. Create a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments) and activate it.

```sh
# Create a virtual environment source .venvazure/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venvazure   
source .venvazure/bin/activate
```

2. install postgresql & admin

```sh
brew install postgresql
brew install pgadmin4
```

1. Install production requirements:

```sh
python3 -m pip install -r src/requirements.txt
```

2. Start the PostgreSQL server:

```sh
brew services start postgresql@14
```


1. Apply database migrations and seed initial data:

```sh
python3 src/manage.py migrate
# python3 src/manage.py loaddata src/seed_data.json
```

## Running locally

If you're running the app inside VS Code or GitHub Codespaces, you can use the "Run and Debug" button to start the app.

```sh
python3 src/manage.py runserver 8000
```

### Admin

This app comes with the built-in Django admin interface.

1. Create a superuser:

```
python3 src/manage.py createsuperuser
```

2. Restart the server and navigate to "/admin"

3. Login with the superuser credentials.

## Running tests

1. Install the development requirements:

```sh
python3 -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python3 -m playwright install chromium --with-deps
```

2. Run the tests:

```sh
python3 -m pytest
```

## Documentation

Barodybroject includes comprehensive documentation built with Sphinx.

### Building Documentation

To build the documentation locally:

```bash
# Install development dependencies (includes Sphinx)
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Build HTML documentation
cd docs
make html

# Or use the build script
chmod +x scripts/build_docs.sh
./scripts/build_docs.sh
```

The generated documentation will be available in `docs/build/html/index.html`.

### Documentation Features

- **API Documentation**: Automatically generated from docstrings
- **User Guides**: Installation, configuration, and usage instructions
- **Developer Guides**: Contributing guidelines and testing procedures
- **Deployment Guides**: Multiple deployment scenarios and configurations

### Online Documentation

The documentation is automatically built and deployed to GitHub Pages on every push to the main branch.

## Deployment

This repo is set up for deployment on Azure via Azure Container Apps.

Steps for deployment:

1. Sign up for a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) and create an Azure Subscription.
2. Install the [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd). (If you open this repository in Codespaces or with the VS Code Dev Containers extension, that part will be done for you.)
3. Login to Azure:

```shell
azd auth login
```

4. Provision and deploy all the resources:

```shell
azd up
```

    It will prompt you to provide an `azd` environment name (like "myapp"), select a subscription from your Azure account, and select a location (like "eastus"). Then it will provision the resources in your account and deploy the latest code. If you get an error with deployment, changing the location can help, as there may be availability constraints for some of the resources.

5. When `azd` has finished deploying, you'll see an endpoint URI in the command output. Visit that URI, and you should see the front page of the app! ðŸŽ‰

6. When you've made any changes to the app code, you can just run:

```shell
azd deploy
```

### CI/CD pipeline

This project includes a Github workflow for deploying the resources to Azure
on every push to main. That workflow requires several Azure-related authentication secrets
to be stored as Github action secrets. To set that up, run:

```shell
azd pipeline config
```

## Development Container Workflow

We've implemented a "push-it-once, pull-it-forever" development container workflow to significantly speed up the development onboarding and environment setup process.

## How It Works

1. **Pre-built Development Image**: Instead of each developer building the Docker image from scratch, we now maintain a pre-built image on Docker Hub that contains all dependencies.

2. **Automatic Image Updates**: When the Dockerfile or requirements change, GitHub Actions automatically builds and publishes a new image to Docker Hub.

3. **Developer Experience**:
   - First-time setup: `docker compose pull && docker compose up`
   - Daily development: Code changes are mounted into the container for instant reload
   - Adding new dependencies: Update `requirements.txt`, push the change, and CI builds a new image

## Manual Image Build (if needed)

You can manually build and push the development container with:

```bash
# From the repository root
docker build -f .devcontainer/Dockerfile_dev \
             -t amrabdel/barody-python:0.1 \
             -t amrabdel/barody-python:latest \
             .

docker login   # enter your Docker Hub credentials
docker push amrabdel/barody-python:0.1
docker push amrabdel/barody-python:latest
```

## Benefits

- **Faster Setup**: New team members can be productive in minutes rather than waiting for lengthy builds
- **Consistent Environment**: Everyone uses exactly the same container image
- **Reduced Resource Usage**: BuildKit caching reduces CI build times and bandwidth usage
- **Hot Reload**: Your local code changes are immediately available inside the container

## Required GitHub Secrets

For the CI workflow to function, add these secrets to your GitHub repository:

- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`: A Personal Access Token from Docker Hub (not your password)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the development container:

1. Try pulling the latest image: `docker pull amrabdel/barody-python:latest`
2. Check for any pending changes in the GitHub Actions "Build & publish dev-container" workflow
3. For local debugging, you can temporarily switch back to building locally by changing `image:` to `build:` in the docker-compose file
