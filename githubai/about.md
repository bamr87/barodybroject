# ðŸ“¦ GitHub Issue Automation with OpenAI

**Automate GitHub issue management effortlessly with OpenAI's GPT-4 integration.**

---

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project provides a powerful, streamlined solution for automating and structuring GitHub Issues using OpenAI's advanced GPT-4 model. By leveraging GitHub Actions, you can automatically transform generic issue reportsâ€”such as feature requests or bug reportsâ€”into detailed, structured sub-issues that clearly define functional requirements, test plans, and more.

1. **Issue Creation:** A user creates a new issue from a predefined GitHub issue template.
2. **Trigger Workflow:** GitHub Actions automatically triggers upon issue creation.
3. **Invoke OpenAI:** The workflow calls OpenAI's GPT-4 API, passing along structured prompts and the original issue details.
4. **AI Processing:** GPT-4 generates structured, detailed sub-issues based on your templates.
5. **Sub-Issue Creation:** The structured issue is created automatically and linked to the original.
