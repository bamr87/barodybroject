This codebase is a Django-based web application leveraging Python as its primary programming language. It integrates various technologies and follows specific design patterns and best practices:

### Technology Stack:
- **Backend Framework**: Django (Python)
- **Frontend Framework**: Bootstrap for responsive UI design
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (production), SQLite (development/testing)
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose for consistent development and deployment environments
- **Cloud Deployment**: Azure Container Apps, Azure Developer CLI, Azure Bicep for infrastructure as code
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI APIs for AI-driven content creation
- **Static Site Generation**: Jekyll for static content management
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated builds, tests, and deployments
- **Testing**: Pytest and Playwright for automated testing
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for source code management and collaboration

### Design Patterns and Best Practices:
- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**: Clear separation of concerns with Django models, views, and templates.
- **Class-Based and Function-Based Views**: Consistent use of Django's built-in view patterns.
- **RESTful APIs**: Django REST Framework for structured API endpoints.
- **Template Management**: Django templating system with Bootstrap integration for responsive UI.
- **Middleware and Context Processors**: Custom middleware and context processors for authentication, localization, and CMS integration.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Azure Bicep files for provisioning cloud resources.
- **Containerization**: Dockerfiles and Docker Compose for reproducible development environments.
- **Security**: Django built-in security features (XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection protection).
- **Localization and Internationalization**: Django's built-in i18n support.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Azure Application Insights and Log Analytics for monitoring and diagnostics.
- **GitHub Automation**: Scripts and workflows for automated issue handling, CI/CD, and container image management.

### Project Structure:
- **Django Apps**: Modular apps (`parodynews`) encapsulating specific functionalities.
- **Templates and Static Files**: Organized templates and static assets (CSS, JS, images).
- **Scripts and Utilities**: Python scripts for automation, database management, and deployment tasks.
- **Documentation and Guidelines**: Clear coding guidelines, README files, and structured issue templates for collaboration and maintainability.

Overall, this codebase emphasizes modularity, maintainability, scalability, and security, leveraging modern development practices and cloud-native deployment strategies.
