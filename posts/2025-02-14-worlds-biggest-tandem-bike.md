### The Longest Ride

A tandem stretched in length so grand,  
Sixty-seven meters, a wondrous span,  
With thirty-five cyclists, side by side,  
On this colossal bike, they take a ride.  

Wheels turn with laughter, a synchronized team,  
A sight to behold, a record-breaking dream.  
But oh, the challenges in each hopeful stroke,  
For balance and rhythm, it’s teamwork they evoke.  

Through crowded streets, maneuvering seeks,  
A struggle for space that might leave one weak,  
But together they pedal, united and bold,  
In the spirit of joy, their tales will be told.  

Not practical, true, for daily delight,  
Yet brings people closer, a heartwarming sight.  
So here’s to the bicycle, the longest of all,  
A celebration of friendship, let’s heed the call!
