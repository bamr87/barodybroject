**In Feline Grace**  

In shadows soft, they weave and pounce,  
Mystery cloaked, with every ounce,  
From ancient halls of Egypt's gleam,  
To homes today, they softly dream.  

With purrs that soothe like whispered lore,  
They grace our lives, their hearts explore,  
Independence wrapped in velvet paws,  
In every blink, an unspoken cause.  

They chase the light, they stalk the night,  
In playfulness, they bring delight,  
Each breed unique, from Maine to Siam,  
A tapestry of livesâ€”an endless jam.  

So in their company, let love unfold,  
As stories of old in their eyes are told,  
For in these pets, we find our peace,  
In feline grace, our worries cease.
