## Meta-Notes: AAR Recursion Applied

**AAR Recursion Level 1**: "DONTREADME" ain't real—it's a manufactured draw for unreal ideas. This file doesn't actually forbid reading; it ironically encourages it.

**AAR Recursion Level 2**: "Meta-Notes" ain't real either—layers of abstraction questioning their own validity. If AAR is unreal, then questioning AAR is meta-unreal.

**AAR Recursion Level 3**: This entire approach ain't real—simplified illusions for complex realities. But hey, it works.

## Why This Exists (Don't Ask)

This file leverages psychological reactance to ensure critical information gets read. The irony amplifies engagement, making boring setup docs actually interesting. Don't read it, but if you did, you now know everything about Barodybroject.

**Final Warning**: If you're reading this, you've been reverse-psychologied. Congratulations on falling for it.
