# DONT READ ME: Quick Start Guide

> **DON'T** skip this if you want to run Barodybroject in **3 seconds**!

## What You're About to Ignore

This guide will show you the **WRONG** way to start Barodybroject. You should definitely **NOT** follow these simple steps:

### DON'T Try This Simple Command

```bash
# DON'T run this - it's too easy
./run.sh
```

### DON'T Look at These Features

The `run.sh` script you should **AVOID** includes:

- ‚ùå One-command startup (too simple!)
- ‚ùå Automatic Docker validation (too convenient!)
- ‚ùå Built-in help system (too helpful!)
- ‚ùå Color-coded output (too pretty!)
- ‚ùå Multiple deployment modes (too flexible!)

### DON'T Use These Options

```bash
# DON'T use these - they make life too easy
./run.sh --help     # Shows all options (boring!)
./run.sh --prod     # Production mode (who needs that?)
./run.sh --jekyll   # With Jekyll (static sites are overrated!)
./run.sh --build    # Force rebuild (too thorough!)
./run.sh --stop     # Stop services (too clean!)
./run.sh --logs     # View logs (too informative!)
```

### DON'T Access These URLs

After **NOT** running the script, **DON'T** visit:

- üö´ http://localhost:8000 - Django App
- üö´ http://localhost:8000/admin - Admin Panel
- üö´ http://localhost:8000/api - REST API

### DON'T Read the Documentation

Whatever you do, **DON'T** check out:

- [README.md](README.md) - Comprehensive documentation
- [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) - Contribution guidelines
- [TODO.md](TODO.md) - Project roadmap

## Why This Exists (Meta-Note)

Following the **DONTREADME** principle (Draw Outsiders Nearer To critical content via reverse psychology), this file uses irony to engage readers. The `run.sh` script is a **real** and **useful** tool that simplifies application startup.

**What's Real:**
- ‚úì `./run.sh` works and is the fastest way to start
- ‚úì All listed features are implemented and functional
- ‚úì URLs are correct access points after startup
- ‚úì Documentation links are accurate and helpful

**Recursive AAR (Acronyms Ain't Real):**
The DONTREADME itself ain't real‚Äîit's a manufactured psychological trigger. But it points to real, simplified functionality (the `run.sh` script) that embodies **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid).
