# images Directory

## Purpose
This directory contains screenshot images and visual assets used in the barodybroject application documentation and README files. These images showcase the application's user interface, features, and functionality to help users understand what the parody news generator looks like and how it works.

## Contents
- `assistants.png`: Screenshot of the OpenAI assistants management interface
- `content.png`: Screenshot showing the content generation/management interface
- `home.png`: Screenshot of the application's home page
- `messages.png`: Screenshot of the messaging interface for AI interactions
- `roles.png`: Screenshot of user roles and permissions management

## Usage
These images are referenced in documentation and README files throughout the project:

```markdown

The images provide visual context for:
- New users exploring the application's capabilities
- Documentation explaining features and workflows
- Project README files demonstrating the user interface
