## 🔧 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- GitHub repository.
- OpenAI API access ([Get your API key here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)).

### Installation & Setup

#### Step 1: Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/readmeai.git
cd readmeai
```

#### Step 2: Setup Python Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Step 3: Configure GitHub Actions
Copy GitHub Actions workflow YAML files (`openai-issue-processing.yml` and `readmeai.yml`) into `.github/workflows/`.

#### Step 4: Define Issue Templates
Add provided templates into `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`, customizing prompts as needed.

Example (`feature_functional_requirements.md`):

```md
---
name: Feature Functional Requirements
about: AI-generated functional requirements based on feature request
title: "[Functional Requirement]"
labels: ["functional requirements", "auto-generated"]
---
<!-- TEMPLATE: feature_functional_requirements.md -->

## Functional Requirements

```

#### Step 5: Set Up GitHub Secrets
Navigate to `Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions`, then add:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API Key.
- Optional: `OPENAI_ORG_ID`: Your OpenAI Organization ID.
