## Usage
This Django app provides the core functionality of the parody news generator:

```python

from django.urls import path, include
urlpatterns = [

]
```

Key features include:
- OpenAI assistant management and configuration
- Content generation workflows using AI
- User interface for creating and managing parody news articles
- Integration with Django CMS for content management
- REST API endpoints for programmatic access

## Container Configuration
