# foobar Directory

## Purpose
This directory contains test and example code structures used for development testing, code pattern demonstrations, and educational purposes within the parodynews Django application. It provides sample implementations and testing patterns that can be referenced during development and used for learning Django application architecture.

## Contents
- `foo/`: Subdirectory containing example module structure and Python package initialization (has its own README)
- `bar/`: Subdirectory containing nested module examples and hierarchical package organization (has its own README)

## Usage
This directory serves as a reference for Django application structure and testing patterns:

```python
# Example usage of foobar modules
from parodynews.foobar.foo import example_function
from parodynews.foobar.bar.baz import nested_example

# Testing patterns and module organization
class TestFoobarPatterns:
    def test_module_structure(self):
        # Test module imports and structure
        assert hasattr(example_function, '__call__')
        assert nested_example is not None
```

Development features:
- **Module Structure Examples**: Demonstrates proper Python package organization
- **Testing Patterns**: Sample code for testing hierarchical module structures
- **Development Reference**: Examples of Django app organization and patterns
- **Educational Content**: Learning materials for Django development best practices
- **Code Templates**: Reusable patterns for creating new modules and packages

## Container Configuration
Foobar modules are included in Django application container:
- Python package structure maintained in container environments
- Import paths resolved correctly in containerized Django applications
- Testing patterns work within container-based test execution
- Development examples accessible in development container environments

## Related Paths
- Incoming: Referenced by developers learning Django application structure and testing patterns
- Outgoing: Provides example patterns and structures for use in other parts of the application
