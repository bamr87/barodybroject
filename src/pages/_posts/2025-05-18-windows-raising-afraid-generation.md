## Act I: A World Held Hostage by the Right-Click—How Microsoft Put the “Proprietary” in “Productivity”

Once upon a silicon-coated nightmare, humanity awoke each morning to a chorus of chimes only slightly less ominous than the Jaws theme. Schoolchildren learned “computer science” by selecting themes in PowerPoint. Entire professions sprouted around bolding text and discovering which combination of mouse clicks finally let them draw a circle in Word. Meanwhile, a fruitless quest raged to find “My Computer,” which, despite suggesting a sense of ownership, stubbornly revealed nothing about how it dangled together behind the screen.

It was an age of Windows Wizards: daring users who could drag desktop icons into the Recycle Bin yet cowered at the cryptic sorcery of a C:\ prompt. Microsoft’s legacy? Billions could “use a computer” but only a select few could “make a computer do new things.” If you were hoping to learn how to build the future, Windows wanted to know if you’d like another Solitaire theme instead.

As late as 2020, roughly **80% of schools taught “tech” as “using Google Slides.”** Terminal? “Is that a flight gate?” (Source: International Society for Technology in Education)

## Act II: Mac OS X – The Accidental Coding Bootcamp for Hipsters (And Scientists, Too)

While Windows hid all the gears, something extraordinary happened at Apple HQ: they built Mac OS X on Unix. Suddenly, anyone with a sleek silver rectangle gained a portal to a world unknown: *Terminal*. And it wasn’t just the bearded few. Hackers, playwrights, PhD candidates, and yes, that guy you always see in Starbucks, all discovered the cryptic joys of “sudo rm -rf /” and the dark art of escaping Vim.

Meanwhile, Linux quietly powered the internet, weather satellites, and half of Mars. Of course, it required a small tribute—your free time and social life—but rewarded you with literacy in the ancient runes of “sudo,” “git,” and “grep.”

### **Actual Gasp-Worthy Stat:**
Stack Overflow’s surveys find that **90% of heavy Unix users self-report coding and scripting skills**—as opposed to the Windows majority, who believe PowerShell is a villain on *Doctor Who*.

## Act III: Corporate Stockholm Syndrome—Why We Never Escape the Black Box

While Mac and Linux users forged new civilizations on the command line, enterprises were chained to Active Directory, where innovation went to die and “reboot” was the answer to every technical question. IT departments became keepers of sacred Excel macros; business productivity was measured by Outlook load times.

The cultural results? Offices full of highly skilled “users”… just don’t ask anyone to do anything that isn’t already a right-click option. The spirit of curiosity dissolved faster than a Chrome session with 87 tabs.

### **Factoid for Your Next Sad Meeting:**
A recent Gallup poll suggests **70% of enterprise workers only ever engage with software as consumers, not creators or customizers**—unless led by that one mythical “IT ninja” who can do magic with batch files.

## Act IV: Plots Twist Harder Than a PageUp Key—Microsoft Buys GitHub, the Open Source Disneyland

As if to prove irony is the only true constant, Microsoft—the architect of the black box—bought *GitHub*, humanity’s greatest open-source playground. In other words: The same company that inspired two generations to fear their own computers now owns the world’s greatest code-sharing platform.

Yet, in a twist fit for a sitcom, Microsoft went open-source-crazy. Crocodile tears aside, they nurture GitHub, contribute to Linux, and let Visual Studio Code charm developers across all operating systems (even their historic rivals). The result? The nerds inherited the Earth, with Redmond serving the refreshments.

### **Evidence, Seriously:**
Microsoft is a top contributor to open-source projects now, and GitHub hosts **over 370 million public repositories**—making this merger the greatest “frenemy” story since Batman and the Joker went fishing together. (Source: GitHub Octoverse 2023)

## Act V: The Divide—Echoes of the Soft-Walled Garden

After decades of divergent digital evolution, society cleaves into two camps:

| Users                  | Main Skill           | Typical Outcome                          |
|------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Windows Only           | Right-click mastery | Panics at sight of black screens         |
| macOS/Linux/Power User | Terminal wizardry   | Writes scripts, conquers worlds, drinks cold brew |

Windows folks excel at “using” tech, but are rarely empowered to “make” tech, fueling a gap so wide even a Clippy couldn’t paperclip it shut. Should this worry us? Well, in Stack Overflow’s 2023 survey, UNIX-heads outscore on every “build” metric, and bootcamps steer learners away from anything with a Start Menu.

## Act VI: Redemption.exe — How We Can All Reboot Ourselves

But wait! Before you throw your mouse out the window (or downvote this article out of existential dread), here’s the hopeful twist: Microsoft has started smudging the fortress walls.

- **Windows Subsystem for Linux** now lets you run Bash on Windows, so the next Ada Lovelace might very well be born on a Dell Inspiron. 
- **Schools and learners everywhere** have more access than ever to open-source tools, supported by a new cultural vibe: “Hey, you can fix this! (And yes, you might break something first.)”

This is our moment. The divide is real—but not immutable. Every time you open a shell, every time you Google “how to script this thing instead of clicking for an hour,” you close it a bit more.

## Epilogue: Turn Anxiety into Action

Let’s face it: a world where everyone is doomed to repeat the ritual of “CTRL-ALT-DEL” is a world that deserves a better untangling. True, Windows gilded the cage, but Microsoft now hands you a set of bolt cutters—if you know where to look.

**Actionable Ways to Reboot Your Digital Destiny:**
- **Open Terminal:** On any system. Type something new. Break something (small!).
- **Clone a Hello World Project:** GitHub is free, friendly, and won’t bite.*
- **Find a Coding Friend:** It’s like having a gym buddy, but instead of squats you learn “sed -i” and why semicolons haunt you.
- **Teach Your Grandma Bash:** Because a little terror never hurt anyone, and besides, she already survived the fidget spinner trend.

Remember: Every technological revolution starts with one brave soul who double-clicked “run as administrator” and refused to stop there.

**The future needs users. But it also desperately needs more creators.  
Why not be both?**
