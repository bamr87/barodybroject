### Egyptian Macaroni Bechamel

Egyptian Macaroni Bechamel is a comforting and creamy baked pasta dish layered with ground beef and bechamel sauce. It’s similar to Greek pastitsio or Italian lasagna and is a favorite in Egyptian households. Here’s how you can make this delicious dish:

#### Ingredients

**For the Pasta Layer:**
- 500g (1 lb) penne or rigatoni pasta
- Water for boiling
- Salt for boiling
- 2 tablespoons olive oil

**For the Meat Layer:**
- 500g (1 lb) ground beef
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and black pepper, to taste
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon ground allspice
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1/4 cup water

**For the Béchamel Sauce:**
- 4 tablespoons butter
- 4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 4 cups whole milk
- Salt and white pepper, to taste
- A pinch of nutmeg

**Additional Ingredients:**
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan or Egyptian Rumi cheese (optional for topping)
- 1 egg, lightly beaten

#### Instructions

1. **Cook the Pasta:**
   - Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add salt and a drizzle of olive oil.
   - Add the pasta and cook until al dente, following package instructions. Drain and set aside.


2. **Prepare the Meat Layer:**
   - In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat.
   - Add the chopped onions and sauté until translucent.
   - Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute.
   - Add the ground beef and cook until browned. Break it up with a spoon to ensure even cooking.
   - Season with salt, black pepper, cinnamon, and allspice.
   - Stir in the tomato paste and water. Allow the mixture to simmer for about 10 minutes until a thick sauce forms. Set aside.


3. **Make the Béchamel Sauce:**
   - In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
   - Add the flour, whisking continuously to form a smooth paste. Cook for about 1-2 minutes to eliminate the raw flour taste.
   - Gradually add milk, continuing to whisk to prevent lumps.
   - Bring the mixture to a gentle boil while continuously stirring. It should thicken to a creamy consistency.
   - Season with salt, white pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg. Remove from heat.


4. **Assemble the Dish:**
   - Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
   - Grease a large baking dish with butter or olive oil.
   - Mix 1/3 of the béchamel sauce with the drained pasta and add the beaten egg to this mixture. This helps the pasta stick together.
   - Spread half of the pasta in the prepared baking dish.
   - Layer all of the meat mixture over the pasta.
   - Top with the remaining pasta.
   - Pour the rest of the béchamel sauce evenly over the top.
   - If using, sprinkle the grated Parmesan or Rumi cheese over the béchamel sauce.


5. **Bake:**
   - Bake in the preheated oven for about 30-40 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and bubbly.


6. **Serve:**
   - Allow the dish to cool slightly before cutting into slices. This helps it hold together when serving.

#### Prep Tips
- **Béchamel Consistency**: Aim for a sauce that is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. If it’s too thick, add more milk. If too thin, cook longer while stirring.
- **Flavor Boost**: For additional depth, you can add a bay leaf while making the béchamel sauce and remove it before assembling the dish.
- **Cheese Option**: While Parmesan or Rumi is recommended, you can use any similar hard cheese available.

Enjoy your homemade Egyptian Macaroni Bechamel, a savory blend of creamy, spiced goodness!
