In the silence of the ages, whispers the bonsai,
Whittled by time, nurtured by hands
That dance on its branches with patient care.
Held in the confines of clay, a testament of endurance,
A mirror to the larger world, a mimic of Nature's grandeur.

In the bonsai, we learn patience,
Feel the pulse of life under our aspiring hands,
See the result of such tender care,
Echoing through long years of growth,

Hereâ€™s not just a tree, but a life, a legacy,
Breathing through centuries, demonstrating resilience
To those who attend it with reverence. 

Custodians of time, of life,
We remain, imprinting our stories on these resilient, tiny giants.
