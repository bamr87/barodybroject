## The Infamous "Snowpocalypse" of 1987: DeKalb Gets an Unwanted Ice Age 

### Introducing the Snowmageddon of Yore

Ah, DeKalb, Illinois—where the corn grows tall, and the snow apparently never stops. The town gained an ever-so-glamorous spotlight in 1987. Not for some joyous occasion, but rather for being buried alive under a veritable Everest of snow. Yes, folks, the much-ballyhooed "Blizzard of 1987" arrived to cackle maniacally at our feeble human contingency plans. 

### Meteorological Misconduct: The Elements' Cold War

So how does one "win" a blizzard? Easy: Combine Arctic air colder than your ex's heart with Gulf moisture more persistent than spam calls. This joyous union yielded up to 24 inches of white chaos, gleefully blanketing not just innocent DeKalb but large swaths of the unsuspecting Midwest. Strong winds decided to join the party too, throwing an impromptu jazz hands performance with reduced visibility. Applause anyone?

### Human Malaise and Frosty Follies

As expected, school buses morphed into sledges, while school closures turned children into impromptu snow wizards of boredom. Businesses shuttered their doors, commuters stranded like abandoned penguins on an ice floe, and the humble shovel became a DeKalban's Excalibur. Snow emergencies were declared, practically by megaphone, as residents were exhorted to transform into frozen couch potatoes.

Authorities? Oh, they did their best to make decrees about "remaining indoors" sound comforting while the snow accretion turned home exteriors into the wintry Tunnels of Mordor.

### A Brief Dip into DeKalbian Ice-folklore

If you're clutching your hot cocoa for dear life, it’s likely due to your fond memories of safety drills in the frigid hallways of history. Let's remind ourselves that other epic storms of yesteryear exist, but none as distinctly DeKalban as the 1987 juggernaut. Meteorologists have an entire tome on its severity, capturing the surprisingly petty grudge Mother Nature held against our humble corn haven.

### So, What Did We Learn?

While technology helped in predicting the coming of Frosty Armageddon, the blizzard taught DeKalbians two critical lessons: the importance of communal empathy and, naturally, owning a really good snowblower. Despite hyper-advanced forecasting tools, it's our good old-fashioned neighborliness that continues to save our frost-nipped souls.

### Reflections on a Frozen Ordeal

Gazing back through the icy fog of time, the Blizzard of 1987 is a DeKalbian badge of honor—or perhaps, more accurately, a medal of survival. Every snowflake melted, every treacherous road cleared, leaves behind a story of brave DeKalb's dance with winter’s formidable and laughably overblown drama. 

So if you’re ever puzzled about why the locals stockpile shovels like vintage collectibles, just remember: they lived through the snowpocalypse of ‘87. And they've got the chattering teeth and triumphant tales to prove it.
