### Introduction

Over the past decade (2013–2023), wheat prices have experienced significant fluctuations due to various factors such as weather events, geopolitical tensions, and shifts in global supply and demand. For Egypt, one of the world's largest importers of wheat, these price movements have had substantial implications for its economy and food security policies.

### Global Wheat Price Trends (2013–2023)

#### Overview of Price Movements

- **2013–2014**: Wheat prices were relatively high, influenced by concerns over supply shortages from major producers and strong global demand.
- **2015–2016**: Prices declined due to consecutive years of record global wheat production, leading to abundant supplies and increased global stocks.
- **2017–2018**: Prices stabilized but remained relatively low as global production met demand.
- **2019–2020**: Prices began to rise modestly due to adverse weather affecting crops in key-producing regions and increased demand from countries building up reserves.
- **2021–2022**: Wheat prices saw significant spikes, reaching some of the highest levels in recent years, largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on supply chains and the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
- **2023**: Prices remained elevated and volatile due to ongoing geopolitical tensions and weather events affecting production in several regions.

#### Key Price Benchmarks

- **Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) Wheat Futures**: A widely used benchmark for global wheat prices.

  - **2013**: Approximately $6.50–$7.00 per bushel.
  - **2016**: Dropped to around $4.00–$5.00 per bushel.
  - **2021**: Rose to over $7.00 per bushel.
  - **Early 2022**: Spiked to over $10.00 per bushel following the escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
  - **2023**: Fluctuated between $7.00–$9.00 per bushel, reflecting continued market uncertainty.

### Factors Influencing Wheat Prices

#### Supply and Demand Dynamics

- **Global Production Levels**: Record harvests in certain years led to oversupply and lower prices, while poor harvests due to weather events tightened supplies and raised prices.
- **Demand Fluctuations**: Changes in global demand, including increased consumption in developing countries and stockpiling by some nations, influenced prices.

#### Weather Events

- **Adverse Weather Conditions**: Droughts, floods, and heatwaves in major wheat-producing countries (e.g., the U.S., Canada, Russia, Ukraine, and Australia) affected crop yields.
- **Climate Change Impact**: The increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events contributed to production uncertainties.

#### Geopolitical Tensions

- **Russia-Ukraine Conflict (2022 onwards)**:
  - **Export Disruptions**: Both Russia and Ukraine are key global wheat exporters. The conflict led to significant disruptions in wheat exports due to blockades, sanctions, and damage to infrastructure.
  - **Market Uncertainty**: The conflict created uncertainty in global markets, driving up prices.

- **Trade Policies**:
  - **Export Restrictions**: Some wheat-exporting countries imposed export bans or tariffs to protect domestic supplies during times of shortage, affecting global availability and prices.

#### Macroeconomic Factors

- **Currency Exchange Rates**: Fluctuations in the value of major currencies affected the competitiveness of wheat exports and imports.
- **Energy Costs**: Rising oil and gas prices increased the costs of farming (through higher fuel and fertilizer prices) and transportation, contributing to higher wheat prices.

#### COVID-19 Pandemic

- **Supply Chain Disruptions**: Lockdowns and labor shortages affected the harvesting, processing, and transportation of wheat.
- **Panic Buying and Stockpiling**: The initial stages of the pandemic saw increased demand due to stockpiling by consumers and governments, influencing prices.

### Impact on Egypt

#### Egypt's Wheat Import Dependency

- **Major Importer**: Egypt imports a significant portion of its wheat consumption needs, typically over 12 million metric tons annually.
- **Bread Consumption**: Bread is a staple food in Egypt, and the country has one of the highest per capita bread consumption rates globally.

#### Government Subsidy Programs

- **Bread Subsidies**: The Egyptian government maintains a bread subsidy program to ensure affordable access for its population.
- **Budgetary Impact**: Increases in global wheat prices directly impact the government's subsidy costs and overall budget.

#### Effects of Global Price Fluctuations

- **Rising Import Costs**: Higher global wheat prices increase Egypt's import bills, putting pressure on foreign currency reserves and fiscal balances.
- **Subsidy Reforms**:
  - **Smart Card System**: Implemented to better target subsidies and reduce wastage and fraud.
  - **Gradual Adjustments**: The government has taken steps to reform subsidies to make them more sustainable while trying to minimize the impact on low-income households.

#### Response to the Russia-Ukraine Conflict

- **Supply Challenges**: Egypt sources a significant portion of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine. The conflict disrupted these supplies.
- **Diversification Efforts**:
  - **Alternative Suppliers**: Egypt has sought to diversify its wheat imports by increasing purchases from countries like France, Romania, the United States, and others.
  - **Strategic Reserves**: The government increased its strategic wheat reserves to mitigate the risk of supply disruptions.
- **Domestic Measures**:
  - **Supporting Local Production**: Initiatives to encourage increased domestic wheat production through incentives to farmers.
  - **Price Controls**: Implementing measures to control bread prices and prevent profiteering.

#### Currency Devaluation and Inflation

- **Exchange Rate Movements**:
  - **2016 Devaluation**: The flotation of the Egyptian pound led to significant devaluation, increasing the local currency cost of imports, including wheat.
  - **Inflation**: Higher import costs contributed to rising inflation rates, affecting food prices and the cost of living.
- **Economic Reforms**:
  - **IMF Program**: Egypt engaged in economic reform programs that included measures to stabilize the economy and reduce deficits, impacting subsidy policies.

### Recent Developments

#### Agricultural Initiatives

- **Increasing Domestic Production**:
  - **Land Reclamation Projects**: Government initiatives to expand agricultural land area, such as the "1.5 Million Feddan Project."
  - **Improved Practices**: Adoption of modern agricultural techniques, improved irrigation methods, and high-yield wheat varieties.
- **Challenges**:
  - **Resource Constraints**: Limited water resources and arable land present ongoing challenges to significantly boosting domestic wheat production.
  - **Climate Challenges**: Adapting to climate change impacts remains a key concern for agricultural productivity.

#### International Cooperation

- **Trade Agreements**: Securing trade agreements and partnerships to ensure a steady supply of wheat.
- **Investment in Infrastructure**: Upgrading storage facilities and logistics to reduce post-harvest losses and improve supply chain efficiency.

#### Social Protection Measures

- **Targeted Subsidies**: Efforts to better target subsidies to those most in need, using technology to improve efficiency.
- **Safety Nets**: Implementing social safety net programs to support vulnerable populations affected by economic reforms and rising prices.
