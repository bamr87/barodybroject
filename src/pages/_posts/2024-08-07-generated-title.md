A spider daring a historic climb,
Brought news anchors to over-the-top rhyme.
Its act of fearlessness they spun,
As a suicidal, assassin run.

Headlines screamed of eight-legged plots,
Ignoring simpler spider thoughts.
Studies show these arachnid types,
Climb for food, not for hype.

Let's think of a hope-filled tale instead,
A record climb, with no bloodshed.
Perhaps this spiderâ€™s brave ascension,
Could teach us humans a noble lesson.

From its water spout throne so high,
This tiny creature aims for the sky.
It reminds us to risk, to climb, to strive,
And seek the heights that make us feel alive.
